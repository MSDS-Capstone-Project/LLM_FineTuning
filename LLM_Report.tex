\begin{abstract}
A concise summary (150--300 words) of the problem, methods, and key results.

Achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) hinges on building models capable of flexible, human-like reasoning. A crucial component of this ability is commonsense knowledge, yet training large models fully is resource-intensive and often impractical. In this project, we investigate whether smaller models like GPT-2 can be selectively enhanced for commonsense reasoning tasks through Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods.

Initially, we attempted fine-tuning GPT-2 on the OpenMathInstruct-2 dataset for mathematical reasoning, but training consistently stalled with a high loss of 6.6, reflecting the model’s limitations in handling symbolic and complex instruction tasks. Recognizing these challenges, we pivoted to CommonsenseQA, a multiple-choice dataset designed to test everyday reasoning through implicit world knowledge.

We systematically applied and compared four PEFT techniques: LoRA, Prefix Tuning, IA3, and QLoRA. Instead of updating all model parameters, these methods selectively adjust small, critical parts of the model, particularly within its attention mechanisms. Our results show that IA3 and Prefix Tuning substantially outperform LoRA and QLoRA, achieving up to 50\% validation accuracy in commonsense categories, with noticeable reductions in perplexity.

These findings suggest that PEFT methods can meaningfully strengthen specific reasoning capabilities even in smaller LLMs. Our work supports the idea that modular, targeted training strategies could form a scalable approach for teaching structured knowledge toward AGI. Future directions include expanding to ensemble PEFT methods and scaling experiments to larger models such as Mistral.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}
Provide the context, motivation, and main objectives.

The pursuit of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is fundamentally about building systems that can reason, learn, and adapt with the flexibility and depth of human intelligence. Despite the impressive capabilities of modern Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 and Claude, key gaps remain; particularly in the realm of commonsense reasoning, where implicit world knowledge must be applied beyond memorization or surface-level pattern matching.

Current approaches often involve training ever-larger models using massive datasets and computational resources. However, this brute-force strategy raises practical concerns around scalability, accessibility, and interpretability. Fine-tuning such large models from scratch is increasingly impractical, especially for smaller research groups or applications needing specialized adaptation.

In this project, we investigate whether smaller, more accessible models like GPT-2 can be incrementally strengthened by using Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) techniques. Rather than updating millions of parameters, PEFT methods selectively adapt a small subset of components—particularly within the model's attention mechanisms, which can be thought of as the “brain” of LLMs.

Our primary objectives are threefold:
\begin{itemize}
    \item To assess whether PEFT methods can inject commonsense reasoning capabilities into a basic LLM.
    \item To compare the effectiveness of different PEFT strategies (LoRA, Prefix Tuning, IA3, and QLoRA) in improving model performance.
    \item To reflect on the broader implications for modular training approaches as scalable paths toward AGI.
\end{itemize}

By studying how small, controlled updates can meaningfully improve commonsense reasoning, we hope to gain insights into how structured cognitive skills might be cultivated in language models without the need for massive retraining or scaling alone.



\section{Related works}
\label{sec:background}
Summarize background. Highlight key papers and how they relate to your work.

The development of efficient fine-tuning strategies for Large Language Models (LLMs) has been an active area of research, particularly as model sizes and training costs continue to grow.

\textbf{LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)} \citep{hu2022lora} proposed an approach to insert trainable low-rank matrices into transformer layers, allowing substantial performance gains with only a small fraction of parameter updates. LoRA showed that full-model fine-tuning was often unnecessary for downstream tasks.

\textbf{Prefix Tuning} \citep{li2021prefix} introduced a technique to prepend trainable “soft prompts” to model inputs at each transformer layer. By keeping the model weights frozen and only optimizing the prefix vectors, Prefix Tuning enabled efficient adaptation for generation tasks while maintaining strong performance.

\textbf{IA3 (Input-Adaptive Attention)} \citep{liu2022fewshot} extended these ideas by learning input-dependent scaling factors inside the attention and feedforward modules. IA3 showed particular promise for few-shot fine-tuning, achieving competitive results with significantly fewer trainable parameters.

\textbf{QLoRA} \citep{dettmers2023qlora} further improved scalability by combining 4-bit quantization with LoRA. This made fine-tuning large models like LLaMA-13B feasible on consumer-grade hardware.

Most prior work evaluated PEFT techniques on instruction-following, summarization, or dialogue tasks. However, their application to \textit{commonsense reasoning}—a core component of AGI—remains underexplored. Our project contributes by systematically comparing these PEFT methods on the CommonsenseQA benchmark, focusing on the ability to teach implicit world knowledge to a relatively small model like GPT-2.



\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:methodology}
Explain data, model(s), approach, and experimental setup.

\subsection{Data: CommonsenseQA}
Our initial experiments aimed to fine-tune GPT-2 on the OpenMathInstruct-2 dataset for mathematical reasoning. However, due to GPT-2's limited capacity to understand complex symbolic structures, training stalled at a high loss value of 6.6 without notable accuracy improvements.

Recognizing the mismatch between task complexity and model capacity, we pivoted to \textbf{CommonsenseQA}, a multiple-choice question-answering dataset focused on everyday commonsense knowledge. Each sample in CommonsenseQA consists of a question and four candidate answers, with exactly one correct choice. The dataset is designed to challenge models on reasoning about implicit world knowledge rather than relying purely on surface-level patterns, making it a suitable benchmark for our objectives.

\subsection{Model: GPT-2}
We selected the \textbf{GPT-2 small} model (approximately 125M parameters) as our base architecture. GPT-2's autoregressive nature makes it naturally effective at next-word prediction, which aligns well with the multiple-choice format where short, precise outputs are expected. Additionally, GPT-2's manageable size allowed us to conduct multiple fine-tuning experiments within reasonable compute constraints.

\subsection{Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning Techniques}
We applied and compared four different PEFT methods:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{LoRA}: Introduces low-rank updates within attention weights.
    \item \textbf{Prefix Tuning}: Appends learned prefix tokens to each transformer layer’s input.
    \item \textbf{IA3}: Adds learnable scaling factors to the key, value, and feedforward transformations.
    \item \textbf{QLoRA}: Combines 4-bit model quantization with LoRA to enable memory-efficient fine-tuning.
\end{itemize}
Each method adapts only a small fraction of the total model parameters, keeping the core model weights frozen.

\subsection{Experimental Setup}
We trained all models using a single NVIDIA A100 GPU, leveraging the HuggingFace PEFT library for efficient implementations. Hyperparameters were held consistent across experiments for fair comparison:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Optimizer: AdamW
    \item Learning Rate: 5e-4
    \item Batch Size: 32
    \item Number of Epochs: 10
    \item Early stopping based on validation loss.
\end{itemize}

Evaluation was conducted using two primary metrics:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Validation Accuracy}: Percentage of correct answers selected.
    \item \textbf{Perplexity}: A measure of model confidence on validation sequences.
\end{itemize}

To simulate realistic low-resource settings, we limited training to small-to-moderate compute budgets, avoiding large-scale hyperparameter searches.





\section{Experiments and Results}
\label{sec:experiments}
Present quantitative and qualitative findings. Use figures/tables if needed.

\subsection{Initial Attempts: OpenMathInstruct-2}
Our original experiments with OpenMathInstruct-2 revealed a fundamental mismatch between GPT-2’s architecture and mathematical reasoning tasks. Despite extensive training, the model’s training loss plateaued around 6.6, with negligible improvements in prediction accuracy. This indicated that the complexity and symbolic density of math datasets overwhelmed the representational limits of GPT-2.

\subsection{Pivot to CommonsenseQA}
Recognizing these challenges, we shifted to the CommonsenseQA dataset, which required shorter, sentence-level reasoning better aligned with GPT-2’s capabilities. Commonsense tasks allowed us to better assess the effectiveness of PEFT techniques without being bottlenecked by inherent architectural limitations.

\subsection{Zero-Shot Baseline}
GPT-2's zero-shot performance on CommonsenseQA was near random, achieving approximately 25\% accuracy, as expected for a four-option multiple-choice task. This baseline highlighted the necessity of fine-tuning.

\subsection{Fine-Tuning Results}
We applied four PEFT techniques and observed the following validation accuracies:

\renewcommand{\arraystretch}{1.2}
\begin{tabular}{|l|c|}
\hline
\textbf{Fine-Tuning Method} & \textbf{Validation Accuracy (\%)} \\
\hline

LoRA & 12\% \\
QLoRA & 15\% \\
Prefix Tuning & 46\% \\
IA3 & 50\% \\
\hline
\end{tabular}
\caption{Validation accuracy across different PEFT techniques on CommonsenseQA.}
\label{table:validation-accuracy}
\end{table}

\subsection{Perplexity Analysis}
In addition to accuracy, we tracked perplexity on the validation set as a measure of prediction confidence. Models fine-tuned with IA3 and Prefix Tuning showed a significant drop in perplexity compared to LoRA and QLoRA, aligning with their superior accuracy.

\caption{Training and validation perplexity trends for different PEFT methods (placeholder figure).}
\label{fig:perplexity-trends}
\end{figure}

(Note: Actual perplexity trend plots can be generated and inserted if available.)

\subsection{Qualitative Observations}
Qualitatively, models fine-tuned with IA3 and Prefix Tuning demonstrated a stronger ability to infer implicit relationships between concepts, often selecting reasonable answers even when phrasing was ambiguous. In contrast, LoRA- and QLoRA-fine-tuned models exhibited behaviors closer to random guessing, suggesting weaker internalization of commonsense reasoning patterns.

\subsection{Summary}
Overall, our experiments indicate that IA3 and Prefix Tuning are highly effective at improving commonsense capabilities in GPT-2 under limited resource settings. LoRA and QLoRA, while efficient in other contexts, struggled to produce meaningful gains in this domain.



\section{Discussion}
\label{sec:discussion}
Interpret results, highlight limitations, analyze interesting points.


Our results show that Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods can meaningfully improve the commonsense reasoning capabilities of smaller language models like GPT-2, but their effectiveness varies significantly across techniques.

\subsection{Interpretation of Results}
IA3 and Prefix Tuning were substantially more effective than LoRA and QLoRA. We hypothesize that this is because IA3 and Prefix Tuning directly intervene in the model’s attention mechanisms, which are central to relational and inferential reasoning. By contrast, LoRA and QLoRA mainly inject low-rank updates into the projection layers, which may be less effective at reshaping internal reasoning processes necessary for commonsense tasks.

The significant drop in perplexity scores for IA3 and Prefix Tuning suggests that these methods help the model gain more confident and structured internal representations of everyday knowledge, even without updating most parameters.

\subsection{Limitations}
While encouraging, our experiments have important limitations:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Model Capacity}: GPT-2 small (125M parameters) remains fundamentally limited in its ability to perform deep or multi-hop reasoning.
    \item \textbf{Dataset Simplicity}: CommonsenseQA focuses on relatively shallow commonsense tasks. More nuanced benchmarks could reveal different strengths or weaknesses.
    \item \textbf{Resource Constraints}: All training was conducted under constrained compute budgets, limiting our ability to fully optimize hyperparameters or explore longer training schedules.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Interesting Observations}
A notable qualitative finding was that Prefix Tuning and IA3 models often selected semantically plausible answers even when wrong, suggesting partial internalization of reasoning heuristics rather than pure memorization. Meanwhile, LoRA and QLoRA-fine-tuned models frequently defaulted to random choices, implying weaker structural learning.

These insights reinforce the view that small, targeted interventions inside the model's cognitive core—its attention mechanism—can unlock better reasoning behaviors without requiring full retraining.




\section{Conclusion and Future Work}
\label{sec:conclusion}
